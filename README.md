- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SurWeaver
- ðŸ‘€ Doing random stuff for myself using C#, C++, Python. More often being busy doing pet projects in Godot 4. Sometimes I participate in game jams. I like to make some small but sturdy stuff. Very occasionally the source codes of my applications appear here.
- ðŸŒ± I mostly use Godot for game development; C# and Blazor at my previous work place, can do C++. Sometimes I use Python for momentary needs.
