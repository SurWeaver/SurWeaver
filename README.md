- 👋 Hi, I’m @SurWeaver
- 👀 I make my pet project in recently released stable version of Godot 4. Sometimes I participate in game jams. I like to make some small but sturdy stuff. Very occasionally the source codes of my applications appear here.
- 🌱 I mostly use Godot for game development; C# and Blazor at my work. Sometimes I use Python, GameMaker Studio (1.4, 2) for momentary needs.
