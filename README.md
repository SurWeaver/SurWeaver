- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SurWeaver
- ðŸ‘€ I make my pet project in recently released stable version of Godot 4. Sometimes I participate in game jams. I like to make some small but sturdy stuff. Very occasionally the source codes of my applications appear here.
- ðŸŒ± I mostly use Godot for game development; C# and Blazor at my previous work place, now - C++ is my best friend (because of my new work place). Sometimes I use Python, GameMaker Studio (1.4, 2) for momentary needs.
